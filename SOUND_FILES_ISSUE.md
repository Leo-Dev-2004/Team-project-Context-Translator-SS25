# Sound Files Implementation Issue

## Overview
The application currently has several sound files marked as "NOT IMPLEMENTED YET" in `Frontend/src/renderer.js`. These sound effects need to be sourced, added to the project, and properly integrated.

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented
- `launch_sound` ‚Üí `./Sounds/launch_successful.mp3` - Plays when app launches/connects
- `click_sound` ‚Üí `./Sounds/click.mp3` - Plays on button clicks
- `join_sound` ‚Üí `./Sounds/join.mp3` - Plays when joining a session
- `explanation_sound` ‚Üí `./Sounds/explanation_received.mp3` - Plays when explanation is received

### ‚ùå Missing Sound Files
The following sound variables are currently set to `'NOT IMPLEMENTED YET'`:

1. **error_sound** - Should play when errors occur (WebSocket failures, etc.)
2. **notification_sound** - Should play for general notifications
3. **leave_sound** - Should play when leaving/disconnecting from a session
4. **mute_sound** - Should play when microphone is muted
5. **unmute_sound** - Should play when microphone is unmuted

## Sound Source
All sounds should be sourced from: **[Modern User Interface Sound Effects](https://creatorassets.com/a/modern-user-interface-sound-effects)**

This library provides royalty-free UI sound effects that are perfect for our application.

### Naming Convention
- Use lowercase with underscores for multi-word names
- Use `.mp3` extension
- Be descriptive but concise

## Implementation Steps

For each sound file, the assigned team member should:

1. **Browse the Sound Library**
   - Visit https://creatorassets.com/a/modern-user-interface-sound-effects
   - Preview sounds that match the requirements
   - Select the most appropriate sound

2. **Download and Prepare**
   - Download the selected sound file
   - Ensure it meets technical specifications
   - Convert format if necessary (use tools like Audacity, FFmpeg, or online converters)
   - Optimize file size if needed

3. **Add to Repository**
   - Place the file in `Frontend/Sounds/` directory
   - Use the exact filename specified in the task
   - Verify the file plays correctly

4. **Update Code**
   - Update `Frontend/src/renderer.js`
   - Replace `'NOT IMPLEMENTED YET'` with the correct path
   - Example: `const error_sound = './Sounds/error.mp3';`

5. **Test**
   - Test the sound in the application
   - Verify volume levels are appropriate
   - Ensure the sound plays at the right trigger points

## Code Changes Required

In `Frontend/src/renderer.js`, update these lines:

```javascript
// Before:
const error_sound = 'NOT IMPLEMENTED YET';
const notification_sound = 'NOT IMPLEMENTED YET';
const leave_sound = 'NOT IMPLEMENTED YET';
const mute_sound = 'NOT IMPLEMENTED YET';
const unmute_sound = 'NOT IMPLEMENTED YET';

// After:
const error_sound = './Sounds/error.mp3';
const notification_sound = './Sounds/notification.mp3';
const leave_sound = './Sounds/leave.mp3';
const mute_sound = './Sounds/mute.mp3';
const unmute_sound = './Sounds/unmute.mp3';
```

## Where Sounds Are Used

Reference the following locations in the codebase where these sounds are triggered:

- **error_sound**: Triggered in `_initializeWebSocket()` when `this.backendWs.onerror` occurs
- **notification_sound**: Used in `_showNotification()` for general notifications
- **leave_sound**: Triggered in `disconnectedCallback()` and `this.backendWs.onclose()`
- **mute_sound**: Would be triggered when mute button is clicked (implementation needed)
- **unmute_sound**: Would be triggered when unmute button is clicked (implementation needed)

## Quality Guidelines

When selecting sounds, consider:

1. **Consistency**: All sounds should feel like they belong to the same UI family
2. **Volume**: Ensure similar volume levels across all sounds (normalize if needed)
3. **Duration**: Keep sounds brief to avoid disrupting user experience
4. **Clarity**: Sounds should be clear and serve their intended purpose
5. **Pleasantness**: Avoid harsh or annoying sounds that users might find irritating
6. **Accessibility**: Consider that these sounds will be heard frequently
