Verification script for STT heartbeat WebSocket state fix

This script demonstrates the fix for the "no close frame received or sent" error
by showing how WebSocket state is now checked before sending messages.

The fix prevents attempts to send data through a closed WebSocket connection,
which was causing the error reported in the issue.
