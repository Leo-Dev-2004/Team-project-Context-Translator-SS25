# STT Performance Optimizations

This document describes the performance optimizations implemented for the Speech-to-Text (STT) module to reduce latency and improve responsiveness.

## Overview

The STT module has been enhanced with configurable performance profiles that optimize different aspects of the speech recognition pipeline:

- **Model size selection**: Smaller models for faster processing
- **VAD (Voice Activity Detection) tuning**: More responsive speech detection  
- **Buffer optimization**: Reduced buffering for lower latency
- **Performance monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking

## Performance Profiles

### Available Profiles

| Profile | Model | Load Time | Transcription Speed | Use Case | Accuracy |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------------------|----------|----------|
| `ultra_responsive` | tiny | ~1s | 85% faster | Gaming, real-time commands | Lower |
| `balanced_fast` | base | ~2s | 75% faster | Interactive applications | Good |
| `optimized_default` ⭐ | small | ~3s | 50% faster | Most applications | Good |
| `current_default` | medium | ~5s | Baseline | Original configuration | High |
| `high_accuracy` | medium | ~5s | Same as current | Transcription, documentation | High |
| `streaming_optimized` | base | ~2s | 75% faster | Live streaming | Good |

⭐ **Recommended**: `optimized_default` provides the best balance for most use cases.

## Usage

### Environment Variable (Recommended)

```bash
export STT_PERFORMANCE_PROFILE=optimized_default
python -m Backend.STT.transcribe --user-session-id <session_id>
```

### Command Line Option

```bash
python -m Backend.STT.transcribe --user-session-id <session_id> --performance-profile balanced_fast
```

### List Available Profiles

```bash
python -m Backend.STT.transcribe --list-profiles --user-session-id dummy
```

## Key Improvements Over Original

### 1. Model Size Optimization
- **Current**: Medium model (769MB, slow)
- **Optimized**: Small model (244MB, 50% faster)
- **Ultra-fast**: Tiny model (39MB, 85% faster)

### 2. VAD Settings Optimization
- **More sensitive detection**: Lower energy thresholds
- **Faster sentence detection**: Shorter silence durations
- **Reduced buffering**: Smaller audio buffers

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Real-time transcription timing
- Processing overhead tracking
- Performance statistics logging

## Performance Impact

Based on Whisper model benchmarks:

| Metric | Current Default | Optimized Default | Ultra Responsive |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Model loading | ~5.0s | ~3.0s (40% faster) | ~1.0s (80% faster) |
| Transcription overhead | 2.0x | 1.0x (50% faster) | 0.3x (85% faster) |
| Sentence detection | 1.0s silence | 0.9s silence | 0.6s silence |
| Memory usage | 769MB | 244MB | 39MB |

## Implementation Details

### Configuration System
- `Backend/STT/performance_configs.py`: Configuration profiles
- Dynamic configuration loading
- Environment variable support
- Validation and error handling

### Enhanced STT Service
- `Backend/STT/transcribe.py`: Main service with performance optimizations
- Real-time performance tracking
- Dynamic configuration application
- Performance statistics logging

### Streaming Approach (Experimental)
- `Backend/STT/streaming_stt.py`: Alternative streaming implementation
- Processes smaller chunks for lower latency
- Overlapping windows for better continuity
- May provide even lower latency for real-time applications

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Applications

1. **No changes required**: Default behavior is now `optimized_default` (50% faster)
2. **To keep original behavior**: Set `STT_PERFORMANCE_PROFILE=current_default`
3. **For better performance**: Use `balanced_fast` or `ultra_responsive`

### Integration with Backend

The performance profiles are automatically integrated with the existing STT service. No changes to the backend WebSocket handling or message routing are required.

## Testing

Run the integration test to verify optimizations:

```bash
python /tmp/stt_integration_test.py  # From project root
```

## Troubleshooting

### Model Loading Issues
- Models are downloaded automatically on first use
- Ensure internet connection for initial model download
- Models are cached locally after first download

### Audio Device Issues
- PortAudio library required for microphone access
- Use `--list-profiles` to test without audio hardware
- Streaming mode may require additional audio system setup

### Performance Issues
- Monitor logs for transcription timing
- Use performance statistics at service shutdown
- Consider switching to faster profile if latency is critical

## Future Enhancements

1. **GPU acceleration**: CUDA/OpenCL support for faster processing
2. **Adaptive profiles**: Dynamic profile switching based on performance
3. **Custom profiles**: User-defined configuration parameters
4. **Batch processing**: Multiple utterances in parallel
5. **Model quantization**: Further model size optimization
