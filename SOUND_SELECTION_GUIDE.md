## Sound Pairing Suggestions

### Mute/Unmute Pair

- Unmute: Ascending click (low to high pitch)

**Option 2: Close/Open**
- Mute: Closing sound (soft close)
- Unmute: Opening sound (soft pop)

**Option 3: Toggle Pair**
- Both use same base sound but different pitch
- Mute: Lower pitch version
- Unmute: Higher pitch version

## Overall Sound Design Strategy

### Consistency
All sounds should feel like they belong to the same "family":
- Similar audio quality and production style
- Complementary tones and timbres
- Cohesive emotional palette

### Volume Balance
- Normalize all sounds to similar peak levels
- Error sound can be slightly louder (it's important)
- Click/toggle sounds should be softer
- Test all sounds together to ensure balance

### Avoiding Fatigue
- Keep high-frequency sounds (mute/unmute, click) very short
- Ensure medium-frequency sounds (notification) are pleasant
- Make sounds distinctive enough to identify purpose

### Accessibility Considerations
- Choose sounds with clear, distinct characteristics
- Avoid sounds that are too similar to each other
- Consider users with hearing differences
- Ensure sounds complement (not replace) visual feedback

## Testing Strategy

### Individual Sound Testing
For each sound:
1. Play it 10 times in a row - still pleasant?
2. Play at different volumes - still clear?
3. Play with other sounds - distinguishable?
4. Does it match its purpose?

### Group Testing
Test all sounds together:
1. Can you identify each sound's purpose?
2. Are volume levels balanced?
3. Do any sounds clash or overlap badly?
4. Does the overall soundscape feel cohesive?

### Context Testing
Test in actual use:
1. Does the sound enhance the UX?
2. Is the timing appropriate?
3. Does it become annoying with repetition?
4. Does it distract or help?

| Pleasant when repeated | ⭐⭐⭐ | Very important |
| Appropriate duration | ⭐⭐ | Important |
| File size | ⭐ | Less important |
| Production quality | ⭐⭐ | Important |
| Uniqueness | ⭐⭐ | Important |
