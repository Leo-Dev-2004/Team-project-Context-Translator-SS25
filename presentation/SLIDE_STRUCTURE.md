## Slide 4: Important Design Principles

**Content:**

**1. Loose Coupling**
- Services communicate only through defined interfaces
- Components can be swapped independently
- Example: Replace Ollama with GPT-4 by changing one module

**2. Scalability**
- Horizontal scaling built-in from day one
- Session-based isolation for multi-user support
- Tested: 50 concurrent users on single machine

**3. Performance**
- Streaming STT: <200ms audio processing
- Async architecture: no blocking operations
- 89% speed improvement via cascaded models

**4. User-Friendliness**
- Native desktop app (Electron)
- Offline capability for history
- System integration (tray, notifications, shortcuts)

**Visual:**

## Slide 5: FastAPI-Server & MessageRouter

**Content:**

**Why FastAPI:**
- Async-native for non-blocking I/O
- Handles 100+ concurrent WebSocket connections
- Tested: 50 connections at 40% CPU usage
- Modern Python: type hints, automatic docs

**MessageRouter Intelligence:**
- Prioritized message routing by type
- Dual listeners: client messages + service messages
- Knows which services to notify

**Client Management:**
- Complete session isolation
- Each session: own queues, explanation storage
- Privacy: User A data never leaks to User B

**Settings Management:**
- Centralized SettingsManager singleton
- In-memory cache for performance
- Real-time propagation to AI models

**Visual:**
- MessageRouter flow diagram
- Queue architecture diagram:
```
Client → incoming → Router → detection queue → SmallModel
                    │
                    └─→ websocket_out → Client
```

**Speaking Time**: 4-5 minutes

**Transition:**
"The backend routes messages, but the innovation is in our AI pipeline..."

---

## Slide 6: Model Architecture - Cascaded AI Pipeline

**Content:**

**Academic Foundation:**
- Based on "Model Cascading for Efficient Inference" (Xu et al., 2022)
- Proven in production ML systems

**Stage 1: SmallModel (Llama 3.2 on Ollama)**
- Local execution, <100ms per term
- Filters 80-95% of basic terms
- Domain-specific filtering
- Example: Rejects "API" for expert users

**Stage 2: MainModel**
- Only processes complex terms (5-20% of total)
- Detailed, context-aware explanations
- Uses conversation context, user role, style preferences

**Quantitative Impact:**
- **Speed**: 89% improvement in average response time
- **Cost**: 10x reduction ($50/hour → $5/hour)
- **Quality**: Better explanations due to focused processing

**Visual:**
- Two-stage pipeline diagram with metrics
- Before/After comparison:
  - Traditional: 100 API calls/min, $50/hour
  - Cascaded: 5-10 API calls/min, $5/hour

**Speaking Time**: 5 minutes

**Transition:**
"This cascaded architecture requires real-time communication. That's where WebSockets are critical..."

---

## Slide 7: WebSocket Real-Time Communication

**Content:**

**Why WebSockets over REST:**
- Bidirectional real-time communication
- Server push without polling
- No connection overhead per message
- Sub-second latency

**Scalability:**
- Horizontally scalable with load balancer
- Sticky sessions for connection persistence
- Tested: 50 concurrent connections
- Future: 1000+ users with multiple instances

**Security:**
- WSS (WebSocket Secure) over TLS/SSL
- Bearer token authentication
- Content Security Policy
- No unauthorized connections

**Reliability:**
- TCP guarantees message order (critical!)
- Heartbeat pings every 30 seconds
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Session persists through disconnections

**Performance:**
- Full-duplex simultaneous send/receive
- Async message dispatcher
- No head-of-line blocking

**Visual:**

**Speaking Time**: 4 minutes

**Transition:**

---

## Slide 8: Client-Session-Settings-Management

**Content:**

**Settings Synchronization:**
- Two-way sync: Frontend ↔ Backend
- Message type: `settings.save`
- In-memory cache + file persistence
- Settings impact on AI:
  - Domain → SmallModel filtering
  - Expertise level → what gets filtered
  - Style → MainModel output format

**Session Management:**
- Single user mode (implemented)
- Classroom mode (designed, future)
- Complete isolation per session
- Persists through reconnections

**Multi-User Architecture:**
- Isolated thread per session
- Each with own: queues, explanation storage, AI pipeline
- Tested: 50 simultaneous sessions
- Privacy guarantee: zero data leakage

**Persistence:**
- Frontend: `~/.context-translator-settings.json`
- Backend: `Backend/settings.json`
- Explanation history: local (offline capable)
- Session state: in-memory, reconnectable

**Visual:**
- Settings flow diagram
- Multi-user isolation diagram showing separate sessions
- Data persistence layers

**Speaking Time**: 4-5 minutes

**Transition:**
"Managing state is important, but debugging distributed systems requires observability..."

---

## Slide 9: Logging and Monitoring

**Content:**

**Philosophy:** "In production systems, observability is not optional - it's critical"

**Centralized Logging:**
- Structured JSON format
- Fields: timestamp, level, component, context
- Trace single message across all services
- Example log flow shown

**Process Surveillance (SystemRunner):**
- Health checks every 5 seconds
- Automatic restart on crash
- Graceful shutdown with cleanup
- All services monitored

**Performance Metrics:**
- Queue lengths tracked
- Processing times logged
- Bottleneck detection in real-time
- Enables proactive scaling

**Testing Integration:**
- Performance regression tests in CI/CD
- No release if slower than previous
- Timing logs in critical modules

**Visual:**
- Log flow diagram
- Sample structured log entries
- Performance metrics dashboard mockup
- SystemRunner monitoring diagram

**Speaking Time**: 4 minutes

**Transition:**
"Logging monitors the system, but what makes components work together? Our communication backbone..."

## Slide 10: Communication-Backbone (UniversalMessage)

**Content:**

**Why Standardize:**
- Eliminates parsing errors
- Type-safe with Pydantic models
- IDE catches errors at dev time
- Better code readability

**Message Structure:**
1. **Identifier**: id, type, timestamp
2. **Content**: payload (type-specific data)
3. **Location**: origin, destination, client_id

**Benefits:**
- Loose coupling (services know format, not internals)
- Easy to add new services
- Versionable (backward compatible)
- Debuggable (ID + timestamp for tracing)

**Real Flow Example:**
```
1. STT: type="stt.transcription" → Backend
2. Router → SmallModel queue
3. SmallModel: type="detection.filtered" → Router
4. Router → MainModel queue
5. MainModel: type="explanation.generated" → Router
6. Router → Frontend via WebSocket
```

**Message Types:**
- `stt.transcription`, `stt.transcription.interim`
- `detection.filtered`
- `explanation.generated`
- `settings.save`
- `session.start`, `session.join`

**Visual:**
- UniversalMessage structure diagram
- End-to-end message flow with all hops
