## ü§ñ AI Pipeline (Cascaded Models)

### Academic Foundation
- **Study**: "Model Cascading for Efficient Inference" (Xu et al., 2022)
- **Proven**: Production ML systems, similar to Google Bard

### Stage 1: SmallModel (Llama 3.2)
- **Purpose**: Fast term detection and filtering
- **Speed**: <100ms per term
- **Filtering**: 80-95% of terms rejected
- **Location**: Local (Ollama)
- **Settings Used**: Domain, expertise level

### Stage 2: MainModel
- **Purpose**: Detailed explanation generation
- **Speed**: 1-3s (acceptable for quality)
- **Processing**: Only 5-20% of terms
- **Location**: Can be cloud or local
- **Settings Used**: Domain, expertise, style

### Impact Comparison
| Metric | Traditional | Cascaded | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Speed | Baseline | 89% faster | 9x |
| Cost | $50/hour | $5/hour | 10x |
| API Calls | 100/min | 5-10/min | 10-20x |
| Quality | Good | Better | Focused processing |

## üîå WebSocket Architecture

### Why WebSockets?
- ‚ùå REST with polling: 500ms-2s added latency
- ‚ùå Server-Sent Events: Unidirectional only
- ‚úÖ WebSockets: Real-time bidirectional, persistent connection

### Features
- **Endpoint**: `ws://localhost:8000/ws/{client_id}`
- **Security**: WSS (TLS/SSL), bearer token auth
- **Reliability**: TCP message order, heartbeat every 30s
- **Reconnection**: Exponential backoff, session persists
- **Performance**: Full-duplex, async dispatcher

### Scalability
- Single instance: 50+ connections tested
- Load balancer: 100+ with sticky sessions
- Distributed: 1000+ with multiple backends

---

## üíæ Session & Settings Management

### Session Architecture
- **Single User Mode**: One person, one session (current)
- **Classroom Mode**: Teacher + students (designed, future)
- **Isolation**: Each session gets own queues, storage, AI pipeline
- **Persistence**: Session survives WebSocket reconnects

### Settings Flow
1. User changes setting in UI
2. Saved locally via Electron IPC
3. Sent to backend via `settings.save` WebSocket message
4. SettingsManager updates in-memory + file
5. AI models pull settings when needed

### Settings Impact
- **Domain** (medical, software, legal): SmallModel filtering
- **Expertise** (beginner, intermediate, expert): What gets filtered
- **Style** (concise, detailed, analogies): MainModel output format

---

## üìù UniversalMessage Standard

### Structure
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "type": "stt.transcription | explanation.generated | settings.save",
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "payload": { /* type-specific data */ },
  "client_id": "session-identifier",
  "origin": "STT | SmallModel | MainModel | Frontend",
  "destination": "Backend | Frontend | Service"
}
```

### Key Message Types
- `stt.transcription`: Speech ‚Üí text (final)
- `stt.transcription.interim`: Streaming partial result
- `detection.filtered`: SmallModel ‚Üí MainModel
- `explanation.generated`: MainModel ‚Üí Frontend
- `settings.save`: Frontend ‚Üí Backend
- `session.start/join`: Session management

### Benefits
- Type-safe (Pydantic models)
- Traceable (ID + timestamp)
- Versionable (add fields without breaking)
- Debuggable (trace across services)

---

## üîç Logging & Monitoring

### Centralized Logging
- **Format**: Structured JSON
- **Fields**: Timestamp, level, component, context
- **Benefit**: Trace single message across all services

### Process Surveillance
- **Tool**: SystemRunner
- **Frequency**: Health check every 5 seconds
- **Actions**: Automatic restart on crash, graceful shutdown

### Performance Metrics
- Queue lengths (detect backups)
- Processing times (each stage)
- Bottleneck detection (real-time)
- Regression tests (CI/CD)

### Production Integration
- Can feed into ELK, Datadog, CloudWatch
- Alerts on queue length > threshold

## ‚ùì Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not use a single large model?**
A: Cost and latency. We'd spend $50/hour vs $5/hour, and it would be 89% slower. Cascading lets us filter 80-95% of terms with fast local model, only using expensive model for complex terms.

**Q: How do you handle network failures?**
A: WebSocket heartbeats every 30 seconds detect failures. Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff. Session state persists in backend, so users don't lose context on reconnect.

**Q: Can this scale to 1000 users?**
A: Yes. Architecture designed for horizontal scaling. Current single instance handles 50 users at 40% CPU. With load balancer and distributed AI servers, 1000+ users feasible. We have clear scaling path.

**Q: What about data privacy?**
A: Complete session isolation - User A's data never touches User B's. We can add WSS encryption for sensitive deployments. Local Ollama option means data never leaves your infrastructure.

**Q: How accurate is the STT?**
A: Using faster-whisper, which is industry-leading. Streaming optimization maintains accuracy while achieving <200ms latency. Supports multiple languages.

**Q: What's the biggest technical challenge?**
A: Strategic pivot from Google Meet plugin to Electron app mid-project. Our modular architecture saved us - only frontend changed, backend completely untouched. Completed pivot in 2 weeks.

**Q: Can you swap the AI models?**
A: Yes, that's the point of loose coupling. We can replace Ollama with GPT-4, Claude, or any other provider by changing just the AI module. Models communicate via file queues, not direct calls.

**Q: What about multi-language support?**
A: Whisper supports 90+ languages. AI models need language-specific prompts. Not yet implemented but architecture supports it - would be settings parameter.

**Q: How do you test this system?**
A: 20+ test files covering integration, performance, and components. Performance regression tests in CI/CD. No release if slower than previous. Manual testing with 50 concurrent sessions.

**Q: What makes this production-ready?**
A: Comprehensive logging, health monitoring, automatic restarts, security (auth, encryption), session isolation, tested scalability, complete documentation. It's not just a prototype.

## üöÄ Compelling Opening

**Option 1 (Problem-focused)**:
"Imagine you're in a technical lecture. The professor mentions 'Kubernetes orchestration' and 'microservices architecture'. You want to understand, but stopping to Google would mean missing the next 5 minutes. By the time you catch up, you're lost. This is the problem we solved - real-time, context-aware explanations without interrupting the flow."

**Option 2 (Results-focused)**:
"We built an AI system that's 89% faster and 10x cheaper than traditional approaches, while handling 50 concurrent users. How? By applying academic research on model cascading to create a production-ready, real-time explanation system."

**Option 3 (Innovation-focused)**:
"What if you could have an AI assistant that listens to every conversation and explains complex terms instantly - without sending your data to the cloud, and at 1/10th the cost of traditional AI solutions? Let me show you how we built exactly that."

---

## üí° Closing Statement Options

**Option 1 (Technical)**:
"We demonstrated that modern software architecture principles - loose coupling, horizontal scalability, performance optimization - can create systems that are greater than the sum of their parts. Our cascaded AI pipeline proves that academic research translates directly to production systems with quantifiable improvements."

**Option 2 (Impact-focused)**:
"This project shows what's possible when you combine academic rigor with engineering excellence. We didn't just build a prototype - we built a production-ready system that can be deployed in universities and companies today. The 89% speed improvement and 10x cost reduction aren't just metrics - they're the difference between a demo and a product."

**Option 3 (Future-focused)**:
"We've laid the foundation for a new approach to real-time AI assistance. With our modular architecture, we can scale to 1000+ users, add multi-language support, and integrate with any AI provider. This is just the beginning."
