A: WebSocket heartbeats (30s), automatic reconnection with exponential backoff, session persistence.

**Q: Can this scale to 1000 users?**
A: Yes. Tested 50 users at 40% CPU. With load balancer and distributed AI, 1000+ users feasible.

**Q: What about data privacy?**
A: Complete session isolation, optional WSS encryption, local Ollama means data never leaves infrastructure.

**Q: How accurate is the STT?**
A: faster-whisper is industry-leading. Streaming maintains accuracy with <200ms latency.

**Q: Biggest technical challenge?**
A: Strategic pivot from Google Meet plugin to Electron app mid-project. Modular architecture enabled 2-week pivot.
