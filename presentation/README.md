"We built a modular, scalable system using cascaded AI models that's 89% faster and 10x cheaper than traditional approaches."

### Act 3: Evidence (8 minutes)
"We tested with 50 concurrent users, achieved sub-200ms latency, and created a production-ready system with comprehensive monitoring."

### Act 4: Impact (5 minutes)
"This demonstrates how academic research (Model Cascading) translates to production systems with quantifiable improvements."
